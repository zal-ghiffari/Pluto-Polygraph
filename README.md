# Pluto Polygraph
Pluto Polygraph is a web-based lie detector application that uses a brainwave headset to pick up EEG (Electroencephalography) signals in the brain. Pluto Polygraph uses Deep Learning technology to perform the detection process with the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. The model on the Pluto Polygraph knows with a dataset the human brain's EEG signals.

Pluto Polygraph was built for the purposes of scientific investigation and research. This website is built with Python's Flask technology and Mysql database. With a dynamic and attractive appearance, it can simplify the analysis of lie detection on the web.
