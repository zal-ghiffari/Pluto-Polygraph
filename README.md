# Pluto Polygraph
Pluto Polygraph is a web-based lie detector application that uses a brainwave headset to pick up EEG (Electroencephalography) signals in the brain. Pluto Polygraph uses Deep Learning technology to perform the detection process with the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. The model on the Pluto Polygraph knows with a dataset the human brain's EEG signals.

Pluto Polygraph was built for the purposes of scientific investigation and research. This website is built with Python's Flask technology and Mysql database. With a dynamic and attractive appearance, it can simplify the analysis of lie detection on the web.

  ## MacOS
    - Open python installer file.
    - Click Continue at the next stage starting from Introduction to Installation Type.
    - Enter the computer user password if prompted at the installation stage.
    - If the installation is successful it will appear "Installation was successful".
    - Python testing can be done using the Command Prompt (CMD) the same as in the Windows version.
  ## Linux
    - Download the development package needed to build python.
    - Download the latest python installer file on the official website and there will be a file with the format .tar.xz (tarball) containing the python source code.
    - If a dialog box appears, select Save.
    - Double click on the downloaded file.
    - Extract files.
    - Configure the script and run the following command in the terminal:
      $ cd Python-3.*
      ./configure
    - Wait until the installation is complete.
    - Do a test by writing 'python3 -version' in the terminal.
3. Database / Using XAMPP <br />
4. Cloning Project <br />
